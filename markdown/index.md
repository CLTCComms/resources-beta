# Welcome to the Citizen Clinic Cybersecurity Education Center (C3EC)


**Public Interest Cybersecurity**


The Citizen Clinic is a public-interest cybersecurity clinic at UC Berkeley. It supports the capacity of politically-vulnerable organizations to defend themselves against online threats. Building off [our recent research](https://cltc.berkeley.edu/defendingpvos/) on the ecosystem providing technical assistance to civil society, the clinic supports interdisciplinary teams of students to assess threats to targeted organizations, recommend risk-appropriate mitigations, and to work collaboratively with clients to implement new policies and technical controls that enhance their cybersecurity.
