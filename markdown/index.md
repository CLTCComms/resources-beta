# Welcome to the Citizen Clinic Cybersecurity Education Center (C3EC)


**Public Interest Cybersecurity**


The Citizen Clinic is a public-interest cybersecurity clinic at UC Berkeley. It supports the capacity of politically-vulnerable organizations to defend themselves against online threats. Building off our recent research on the ecosystem providing technical assistance to civil society, the clinic supports interdisciplinary teams of students to assess threats to targeted organizations, recommend risk-appropriate mitigations, and to work collaboratively with clients to implement new policies and technical controls that enhance their cybersecurity.
