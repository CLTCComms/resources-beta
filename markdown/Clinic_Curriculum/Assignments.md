**Evaluation.**

Assignments will largely be evaluated on the following rubric that emphasizes (1) sound rationale in assessments, recommendations, and reflections, (2) “partner-ready” work products which reflect professional quality, and (3) completing the instructions of the assignment or the requirements agreed upon work plan with the partner. 

**General Grading Rubric.**

***Note: Students taking the course for P/NP or S/U are expected to participate in classes and complete all work to the same level of quality as students taking the course for a letter grade.***

**Assignments.**

**1. Partner Deliverables - 60%** 

The largest portion of graded evaluation will be based upon your team’s work and support for its assigned partner. These deliverables may include assessments, recommendations, and guides, each tailored towards the partner’s needs. Each team will also deliver a final report summarizing work performed with their partner.

**2. Individual Assignments - 10%**

Two individual assignments will be given:


* **Current Event Topic Leader (5%):** Each student will sign up to lead one 15 minute discussion at the beginning of most lectures. Students will be expected to locate and share about a recent, current event relevant to the day’s lecture topic. Topic leaders will emphasize interesting or relevant points while other students are expected to ask questions and comment.


* **Community Service (5%):** Students will be expected to participate in a project or event that contributes to assist the security practice of various cross-campus or community partners conducting politically-sensitive work. The teaching team will direct this contribution.

**3. Team Case Study - 10%** 

We want students to be able to discuss and share their experience in the course with others, including future employers. We also want our partners to remain confidential and protected. This being said, each student team will submit a write-up of work performed and takeaways with sensitive information removed. The teaching team will review to ensure your experience is captured in an effective & safe manner.  

**4. Participation - 10%** 

We consider “participation” in three major components: participating in regular class discussions, participating in weekly mentor meetings, and participating in team & partner meeting outside of class hours.



1. **You are expected to attend each official class meeting** and contribute substantially to class discussions. The teaching team should be notified in advance of absences from class meetings (including Clinic Core Hours). You do not need to share the reason for the absence. Not showing up to team check-ins will also negatively impact this grade. 
2. **You are expected to meet with your mentor team at least once a week.** This meeting may take place via teleconference. We will get feedback from mentors if they have not met with you without reasonable cause.
3. **As a rule, two people from your team must attend any partner meeting or call.** While you may not be able to attend every team meeting and partner engagement outside of normal class hours, you are expected to attend and contribute to your team’s effort as often as possible. 

**5. Team Evaluations - 10%** 

Throughout the course, you will submit confidential evaluation forms which ask you to evaluate the contributions of each team member including yourself. Your final course grade will be adjusted, higher or lower, if you are contributing more or less than those within your group. If there are difficulties with any team member, discuss the matter within your team and seek resolution. If you cannot resolve the problem, immediately contact any faculty member, so that we can make an appointment to discuss the situation individually or with the entire group as needed. 

**Late assignments.**

** **As we want to respect the time of our partners and ensure a high level of quality control (the teaching team will review deliverables before it reaches the partner), we expect students to adhere to timelines and due dates. **Each day an assignment is late will result in a letter grade deduction.** Recognizing that emergencies arise and partners may require schedule adjustments, exceptions will be made on a case-by-case basis.
