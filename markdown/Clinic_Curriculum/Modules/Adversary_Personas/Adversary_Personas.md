### ** Activities **

Adversary Personas (https://daylight.berkeley.edu/adversary-personas/) is an improvisational role-playing game designed to help teams think broadly and creatively about their cybersecurity threats.

Developed by researchers from UC Berkeley's Daylight Security Research Lab (https://daylight.berkeley.edu/adversary-personas/), the game focuses on the who of security, by forcing players to ask: who might our adversaries be, what do they want, and what would they be willing to go through to get it?

The game can be played by teams of employees in any organization. It is recommended for groups of between 2-10 people.
